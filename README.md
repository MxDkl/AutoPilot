# Auto Pilot 

## Introduction
This project is a proof of concept that is not really meant for practial use. It is just an experiment.

## Update (Nov 7 23)
It seems that the vision api can not tell exatly where things are in an image which is a shame, as that is what I was hoping for with this project. Maybe this will change in the future.

## How to run 
- Clone the repo
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py [task to complete]

## Supported Platforms
- Windows
